🧾 AI-Powered CRM Analytics Dashboard – Project Report
📌 Project Title:
AI-Powered CRM Analytics Dashboard with Sentiment Analysis and Churn Prediction

👩‍💼 Objective:
To analyze customer feedback data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to:

Predict customer churn

Perform sentiment analysis

Generate actionable insights

Present results in an interactive dashboard

🧠 Key Features:
Sentiment Analysis using VADER

Churn prediction using Logistic Regression

Data clustering using KMeans

AI-generated metrics like average sentiment score, churn rate

Dashboard in Plotly (Google Colab) and optional Power BI

🧪 Workflow
1️⃣ Dataset
A dummy CRM feedback dataset was used with the following fields:

customer_id

feedback_text

churned (1 if customer left, 0 otherwise)

2️⃣ Preprocessing
Cleaned the text (lowercase, punctuation removal, etc.)

Applied VADER Sentiment Analysis → outputs:

compound score

sentiment_label (positive/neutral/negative)

Encoded churn label (0 or 1)

3️⃣ Churn Prediction
Used Logistic Regression on:

VADER compound score

Evaluated accuracy, confusion matrix

4️⃣ Clustering (Customer Segmentation)
Features: churn label, sentiment score

Applied KMeans clustering (n=3) to group customers

Assigned cluster label to each customer

5️⃣ Final Output CSV
Saved final CSV:
📄 enhanced_customer_feedback.csv
Includes:

Original feedback

Sentiment analysis results

Predicted churn

Assigned customer cluster

6️⃣ Visualization (Google Colab Plotly)
Generated dynamic dashboard showing:

Metric	Value
Total Customers	200
Churned Customers	103
Avg. Sentiment Score	0.20

📊 Visuals Included:
Pie chart of Sentiment Distribution

Histogram of Sentiment Scores

Bar chart of Churn vs. Sentiment

Scatter plot of Clusters

📈 Optional: Power BI Dashboard
Can be created using exported CSV:

Cluster-wise customer count

Sentiment vs. Churn slicers

TreeMap of feedback length

Churn prediction filters
